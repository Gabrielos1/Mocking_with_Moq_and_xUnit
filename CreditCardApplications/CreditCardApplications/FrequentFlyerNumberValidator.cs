    ///     - Cost. An external company provides this service and bills per usage
    ///     - Slow. The call takes a long time to complete and will slow down unit tests
    ///     - No test version. The external company does not provide a test version, 
    ///       only a live "real" data production version
    ///     - Unreliable. The external service fails often, making our tests fail
    ///     - Effort. The effort (and/or complexity) to use the real service 
    ///       makes tests painful to write
